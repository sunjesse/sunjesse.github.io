Hi! I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [BetterUp](https://betterup.com) working on LLM applications in the coaching space. I graduated from University of Waterloo with a major in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics and Optimization in 2023. Previously, I was a ML Engineer Intern building up large-scale recommendation systems at [BetterUp](https://betterup.com). I've also been fortunate enough to be advised by [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/), [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ml/), [Mario Ghossoub](https://sites.google.com/site/marioghossoub/), and [David Saunders](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~dsaunder/) working on various research projects from generative models for uncertainty quantification, machine learning for health care, and game theory! 

On a high level, I'm interested in understanding and modeling decision-making and uncertainty as it's one of the pillars to understanding general intelligence. I believe algorithmic decision-making paired with the intuitive nature of human decision-making can lead to many beneficial advancements and discoveries in the world. In particular, I am keen on the analysis and empirical studies of these models to better understand the behaviour and limitations of these tools. By bridging the gap between theory and empirical evaluations, I hope to develop principled and robust algorithms for real world use cases (i.e. probabilistic inference, uncertainty quantification, reliable decision-making systems, incorporating inductive biases)!

Outside of Work
==============
Long distance endurance sports are a big passion of mine and I spend a lot of time training. I've ran two marathons so far and this year I have a goal of running sub 3 in the fall! I also enjoy racing the 10k and half-marathon distances. I've also started dabbling in triathlons as I'll be travelling to Switzerland this June to race my first Ironman 70.3! Always looking for new friends to train with so don't hesitate to reach out :)

In my free time, I also love reading and learning. With all that time spent alone on my Zwift trainer or out on a long run, I've really come to appreciate audiobooks. Some books I love and can't recommend enough are **Where Good Ideas Come From** (Steven Johnson), **Grit** (Angela Duckworth), **Essentialism** (Greg McKeown), and **Birth of a Theorem** (Cedric Villani). As you may have noticed, my favourite genre is non-fiction/biography but always open for new recommendations!
