Currently, I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics and Optimization. I'm currently an ML Engineer Intern building up recommendation systems at [BetterUp](https://betterup.com). I am also fortunate enough to be advised by [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/) and [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ml/). 

My research interests are quite broad as they cover statistics, optimization, and provable machine learning along with their applications in healthcare and social issues. In particular, I am keen on the analysis of these mathematical models to better understand the behaviour and limitations of these tools.  

I will be applying to Masters and PhD programs in Fall 2022! Please find my CV attached [here]() to learn more about me.
