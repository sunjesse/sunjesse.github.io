Hi there! I'm an (incoming) fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics and Optimization. I'm currently an ML Engineer Intern building up large-scale recommendation systems using large language models at [BetterUp](https://betterup.com). I am also fortunate enough to be advised by [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/) and [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ml/). 

**Research Interests** <br/>
On a high level, I'm interested in understanding and modelling decision-making as it's one of the pillars to understanding general intelligence.

On a technical level, my research interests are quite broad as they cover high-dimensional statistics & probability theory, convex & non-convex optimization, and provable machine learning along with their applications in healthcare and social issues. In particular, I am keen on the analysis of these mathematical models to better understand the behaviour and limitations of these tools. By bridging the gap between these subjects, I hope to develop principled and robust algorithms for real world use cases (i.e. uncertainty quantification, reliable decision-making systems, distributional drift, etc.). I will be applying to Masters and PhD programs in Fall 2022! Please find my CV attached [here](https://sunjesse.github.io/cv.pdf) to learn more about me.

I also enjoy long distance running, piano, weightlifting, and _outdoorsy_ activities! Feel free to connect with me :)

Books and Resources
===================
Here are some (non-technical) books I highly recommend:
1. **Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life** by _Héctor García_ and _Francesc Miralles_. 
2. **Where Good Ideas Come From** by _Steven Johnson_.
3. **Thinking in Systems** by _Donella H. Meadows_.
4. **The Birth of a Theorem** by _Cedric Villani_.
5. **Grit** by _Angela Duckworth_.
6. **Principles** by _Ray Dalio_.

Some great mathematics textbooks I highly recommend:
1. **Introduction to Functional Analysis** by _James C. Robinson_. A comprehensive and well-presented dive into the world of functional analysis! Complete proofs of theorems are presented and worked solutions are given at the end of the textbook.
2. **Probability and Random Processes** by _Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker_. I absolutely adore this textbook! Extremely thorough, well-written, and rigorous. Covers probability theory, stochastic processes/Markov chains, queueing theory, and more at the upper undergraduate + early graduate level.
3. **Analysis II** by _Terence Tao_. Great (and indeed classic) first step into real analysis!
4. **Convex Optimization** by _Stephen Boyd_ and _Lieven Vandenberghe_. **The handbook** for convex optimization! Helped me a ton in my optimization courses.
5. **Nonlinear Functional Analysis** by _Klaus Deimling_. Currently working through this book but so far I recommend this textbook as it is very comprehensive albeit dense. In particular, it is a great resource for optimizers! :^)
