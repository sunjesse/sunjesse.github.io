Hi there! I'm an (incoming) fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics and Optimization. I'm currently an ML Engineer Intern building up recommendation systems at [BetterUp](https://betterup.com). I am also fortunate enough to be advised by [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/) and [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ml/). 

My research interests are quite broad as they cover high-diemsnional statistics/probability theory, convex & non-convex optimization, and provable machine learning along with their applications in healthcare and social issues. In particular, I am keen on the analysis of these mathematical models to better understand the behaviour and limitations of these tools.  

I will be applying to Masters and PhD programs in Fall 2022! Please find my CV attached [here]() to learn more about me.

Publications
============
1. Conditional Generative Quantile Networks via Optimal Transport. **Jesse Sun**, Dihong Jiang, Yaoliang Yu. _In preperation/review_. (2022)
2. Machine Learning to Improve Left Ventricular Scar Quantification in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients. Zeinab N Ghaziani, **Jesse Sun**, Raymond H Chan, Harry Rakowski, Martin S Maron, Ethan J Rowin, Bo Wang, Wendy Tsang. _Circulation_. (2020)

Books and Resources
===================
Along with my interest in mathematics, I am also an avid reader! Here are some (non-technical) books I highly recommend:
1. _Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life_ by _Héctor García_ and _Francesc Miralles_. 
2. _Where Good Ideas Come From_ by _Steven Johnson_.
3. _Thinking in Systems_ by _Donella H. Meadows_.
4. _The Birth of a Theorem_ by _Cedric Villani_.
5. _Grit_ by _Angela Duckworth_.

Some great mathematics textbooks I highly recommend:
1. _Introduction to Functional Analysis_ by _Erwin Kreyszig_. A comprehensive and well-presented dive into the world of functional analysis! Complete proofs of theorems are presented and worked solutions are given at the end of the textbook.
2. _Probability and Random Processes_ by _Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker_. I absolutely adore this textbook! Extremely thorough and well-written, it really elevated my interest for statistics and probability theory to the next level.
3. _Analysis II_ by _Terrence Tao_. Great (and indeed classic) first step into real analysis!
4. _Convex Optimization_ by _Stephen Boyd_ and _Lieven Vandenberghe_. **The handbook** for convex optimization! Helped me a ton in my optimization courses.
